America has always prided itself on being a melting pot, but when it comes to actually stirring
the pot, we tend to leave the spoon in the drawer. Our immigration policies destroy the dreams
of thousands every year. Pass today to change that.
Principally, pass because immigrants are vital to the economy.
First, let’s address the point Rep. ___ brings up about Venezuelans being a “drain” on American
resources. It’s simply false. According to a 2022 study by the Migration Policy Institute, refugee
populations often surpass native-born citizens in employment rates after five years, especially
since proper integration policies like the ESL programs outlined in this bill. When we are facing
a huge labor shortage affecting the everyday life of our constituents, especially in the crucial
sectors of agriculture and medicine. Not only passing the right thing to do, it is absolutely
crucial.
Additionally, the $100 million allocation under Section 3 is a smart investment. The American
Immigration Council explains that every dollar spent on refugee integration yields $2 in
economic output within ten years. That means more jobs, more tax revenue, and less strain on
public assistance programs. Rep. ____, you claim this bill is costly, but ignoring this opportunity
costs us more.
But second, pass for regional security in Latin America.
Rep. ___ might claim that this bill only benefits Venezuelan migrants, but that’s not it. This bill
doesn’t just address a humanitarian crisis; it provides a pathway to stabilize the entire Western
Hemisphere. Consider this: The Council on Foreign Relations reported in August 2023 that
Venezuela’s collapsing economy and oppressive regime have already driven over 7 million
migrants to flee to neighboring countries like Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. These nations are
bearing the brunt of a crisis that could spill over into political instability and regional conflict.
By granting refugee status to Venezuelans, the United States alleviates pressure on these
overburdened nations, ensuring they have the resources to maintain their own stability. This is
critical because instability in Latin America often creates a domino effect that directly impacts
the U.S. Through increased trade disruptions, weakened alliances, and surges in irregular
migration at our southern border, the consequences of inaction are far-reaching.
In fact, Brookings tells us in 2022 that regional instability is one of the leading drivers of
transnational crime, including drug trafficking and human smuggling. By absorbing a portion of
Venezuela’s migrant population, we reduce the strain on our neighbors and curtail the growth of
organized crime networks that exploit migrants and destabilize borders. This is an investment in
our own security.
Today, I just have one final question to this Congress. How many more will we stop? How many
more will we shatter? Pass.

When former felonist Tyrone muhammad was released from state prison he went on to start a
violence prevention program to protect the African-American community in chicago. But that
dream was cut short. Tyrone returned to a flood of Venezuelan criminal gang activity, much of
which targeted his own community. Tyrone's final straw was watching this government coddle
these criminals. That's my final straw as well, fail this legislation.
Principally, fail to prioritize our constituents first.
To enhance their country's safety, Venezuela is releasing prisoners and sending them to the
United States, where they will be provided with shelter. Dana Kennedy at the New York post
tells us that Tyrone described the situation as blacks vs migrants. Chicago spent almost half a
billion dollars over the last two years on more than 42,000 migrants who’ve arrived since 2022.
Pushing out local african americans, so they can get more government money for housing
migrants. There are entire areas controlled by these gangs, 720 police incident reports against
them, yet these gang members are being released by courts. A black teen told the post that
they don't get arrested like we do, they receive help to get cars, apartments, EBT cards, and
thousands of dollars whilst not even having a social security number. These are bad people.
Affirming today means we prioritize migrants over people we were elected to serve, our own
constituents.
Second, negate because of an excessive backlog.
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse
At the end of November 2024, out of the total backlog of 3,738,341 cases, 1,740,424 immigrants
have already filed formal asylum applications and are now waiting for asylum. Asylum seekers
go into detention centers, or into areas that accept them and have support networks. Then the
National immigration forum states that the Biden administration hit 4% of their resettlement
goal for immigrants in 2021, part of which is because we shifted our focus to Afghan evacuees,
with the underlying problem being that they were stretched too thin. USRAP is who governs the
procedure by which refugees around the world are screened and selected, yet their not even
mentioned in the bill, it’s a multifaceted process, and multiple institutions are tasked to oversee
After referral, refugees undergo pre-screening at Resettlement Support Centers, followed by
detailed USCIS interviews. They then face extensive security and health checks. Once cleared,
they are matched with U.S. resettlement agencies, receive cultural orientation, and initial
support for three months. Processing times have increased from 18-24 months to up to 10 years
due to additional vetting and other challenges. When the process takes so long, we don't see
any of the impacts that the affirmation brings up.
Tyrone left a community that was impoverished and fragmented, we had 20 years to change
that, yet he still returned to the exact same thing. Fail this legislation, and protect the people that
you were elected to serve.
