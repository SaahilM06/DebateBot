Rep ____, I must admit, I never thought missiles would make me feel safe. But here I am,
hoping that their precision brings peace instead of pandemonium. This legislation isn't about
escalation; it's about insulation—protecting stability in a volatile region. Pass today for the safety
of the millions of innocent civilians in the Levant.
Principally, You affirm today to harbor peace for decades. AP News reported on December 8
that Iran's "Axis of Resistance" is diminishing as several groups around the region begin falling
apart. The Israel Times furthers on this just two weeks ago by reporting that the Iranian proxy
groups like Hezbollah are being knocked down. The situation for Iran is not looking up right now,
meaning that it is the perfect time for America to step in and put an end to the destruction
caused by these proxy groups. America's superior technology and influence finally puts an end
to the destruction caused by these terrorists. The main advocacy that the negation brings to the
table is that this bill creates a regional arms race. But here's the issue: when the proxy groups
are already significantly weakened, they cannot afford to spend resources to match the military
technology of America. Rep ___, this means that conflict doesn't get exacerbated, it gets lulled.
We can’t afford to waste even a second, when each day we hesitate to make a move, a
thousand people perish on the battlefields. their families Only have 3 letters to blame: U.S.A.
But lives are not the only thing at stake today.
Second, you affirm to protect and stabilize the global oil market. Reuters reports in April of 2024
that Iran is the third largest exporter of oil globally. Reuters reports in another article on
December 18, 2024 that Iranian proxy groups have increasingly gotten a hold on oil. It furthers
that the proxy groups evade the sanctions with government loopholes. When Iranian proxy
groups are taken down, the impact goes beyond reducing global terrorism or decreasing
violence in the Levant region: it also makes sure that one of the most important resources in the
world continues to be traded peacefully. But why exactly does American presence in the region
stabilize the oil market? The US Energy Information Administration explains to us that the
Levant region is one of the most vital oil chokepoints in the world, with 20% of the world's oil
passing through there. Today’s legislation uniquely protects this oil, because it’s the first time
that the US actually targets the proxy groups that are destabilizing the oil market in the first
place.
Today, the sound of the gavel for the affirmation cancels out the sound of bombs bursting, guns
firing, and civilians screaming. Millions count on your ballot today for their life. Don't let them
down. Pass.

Framework in case late round:
Only thing that matters in this round is whether or not human lives are saved from the grasp of
iranian proxy groups. Ultimately the affirmation takes the win:
- At the very least by passing we bring about defense systems; systems that STOP the
terror inflicted by iranian proxy group.
- In the negation we have no defense systems
- The only threat the negation gives you is ‘escalation’
- But they act like US has never thwarted Iran, we have before; and in the past
nothing super bad has happened.
