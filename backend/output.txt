America has always prided itself on being a melting pot, but when it comes to actually stirring
the pot, we tend to leave the spoon in the drawer. Our immigration policies destroy the dreams
of thousands every year. Pass today to change that.
Principally, pass because immigrants are vital to the economy.
First, let’s address the point Rep. ___ brings up about Venezuelans being a “drain” on American
resources. It’s simply false. According to a 2022 study by the Migration Policy Institute, refugee
populations often surpass native-born citizens in employment rates after five years, especially
since proper integration policies like the ESL programs outlined in this bill. When we are facing
a huge labor shortage affecting the everyday life of our constituents, especially in the crucial
sectors of agriculture and medicine. Not only passing the right thing to do, it is absolutely
crucial.
Additionally, the $100 million allocation under Section 3 is a smart investment. The American
Immigration Council explains that every dollar spent on refugee integration yields $2 in
economic output within ten years. That means more jobs, more tax revenue, and less strain on
public assistance programs. Rep. ____, you claim this bill is costly, but ignoring this opportunity
costs us more.
But second, pass for regional security in Latin America.
Rep. ___ might claim that this bill only benefits Venezuelan migrants, but that’s not it. This bill
doesn’t just address a humanitarian crisis; it provides a pathway to stabilize the entire Western
Hemisphere. Consider this: The Council on Foreign Relations reported in August 2023 that
Venezuela’s collapsing economy and oppressive regime have already driven over 7 million
migrants to flee to neighboring countries like Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. These nations are
bearing the brunt of a crisis that could spill over into political instability and regional conflict.
By granting refugee status to Venezuelans, the United States alleviates pressure on these
overburdened nations, ensuring they have the resources to maintain their own stability. This is
critical because instability in Latin America often creates a domino effect that directly impacts
the U.S. Through increased trade disruptions, weakened alliances, and surges in irregular
migration at our southern border, the consequences of inaction are far-reaching.
In fact, Brookings tells us in 2022 that regional instability is one of the leading drivers of
transnational crime, including drug trafficking and human smuggling. By absorbing a portion of
Venezuela’s migrant population, we reduce the strain on our neighbors and curtail the growth of
organized crime networks that exploit migrants and destabilize borders. This is an investment in
our own security.
Today, I just have one final question to this Congress. How many more will we stop? How many
more will we shatter? Pass.
