I rise in strong opposition to the proposed bill to strengthen regional alliances to combat Iranian proxy networks in the Levant. While the intentions behind the bill may seem noble, there are significant flaws and misconceptions that must be addressed.

First and foremost, it is crucial to address the opponent's argument regarding the current situation in the Middle East, where Iran is allegedly willing to reduce military support for its regional allies in exchange for the US abandoning its policy of 'maximum pressure'. This argument assumes that Iran will act in good faith and completely disarm its proxy groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis. However, history has shown that Iran is known for deception and has a track record of continuing to support these militant groups through covert means, even if they publicly claim to reduce support. As evidenced in the past, Iran has utilized alternative channels and networks to continue arming and funding these proxies, rendering any potential disarmament efforts merely superficial.

Furthermore, the opponent argues that the bill to strengthen regional alliances is unnecessary in light of potential negotiations with Iran. However, it is crucial to recognize that these Iranian proxy networks, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, pose an immediate and tangible threat to regional stability and security. These groups have a long history of engaging in acts of terrorism, destabilizing governments, and threatening the lives of civilians. Strengthening regional alliances through the placement of Patriot missile systems and increased intelligence sharing is a necessary and proactive measure to counter the threat posed by these Iranian-backed militant groups.

Moreover, the opponent's proposal to rely on diplomatic negotiations with Iran as a sole solution is inherently flawed. Iran's track record of non-compliance with international agreements, such as the Iran nuclear deal, showcases the unreliable nature of diplomatic engagement with the Iranian regime. By solely relying on negotiations without bolstering regional alliances and military capabilities, the US risks emboldening Iran and its proxy networks, allowing them to continue their malign activities unchecked.

In addition, it is imperative to recognize the strategic importance of the Levant region, including Syria, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories, and Iraq. The presence of Iranian proxy networks in this region not only threatens the stability of these countries but also poses a direct threat to US interests and security. Strengthening regional alliances and cooperation is essential to counter the influence of Iran and prevent further destabilization in the region.

Ultimately, the proposed bill to strengthen regional alliances to combat Iranian proxy networks in the Levant is a vital step towards enhancing regional security and countering the dangerous influence of Iran and its proxies. By taking proactive measures to strengthen alliances, increase intelligence sharing, and deploy military resources, the US can effectively confront the threat posed by Iranian-backed militant groups and safeguard regional stability. It is imperative that we prioritize the security and safety of the region by supporting this critical legislation.
