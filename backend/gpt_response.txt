Thank you, Rep ____, honorable judges, and distinguished opponents for this opportunity to engage in rigorous debate on this crucial matter. Today, I stand in firm opposition to the proposed Bill to Strengthen Regional Alliances to Combat Iranian Proxy Networks in the Levant, brought forth by my esteemed colleagues from Katy Taylor High School.

**Contention 1: Escalation and Arms Race Concerns**

The central argument put forth by the affirmative side is that the passing of this bill will not lead to escalation but rather insulation and peace in the region. They contend that the weakening of Iranian proxy groups creates a scenario where these groups are unable to match the military technology of the United States, consequently leading to a lull in conflict. 

However, the catastrophic flaw in this argument lies in the assumption that the weakening of these proxy groups automatically translates into a de-escalation of tensions. In reality, the placement of Patriot missile systems in multiple countries, including Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, coupled with increased military initiatives and intelligence sharing, is likely to provoke retaliatory actions from Iran and its proxies. This bill essentially creates a tinderbox situation where any misstep or miscalculation could easily escalate into a full-blown regional conflict. History has shown us time and time again that military build-up and strategic positioning often lead to heightened tensions, not peace.

Furthermore, the affirmative side fails to consider the longstanding animosities and complex geopolitical dynamics at play in the Middle East. A unilateral show of force by the United States and its allies is bound to provoke a response, potentially dragging the region into a protracted and devastating conflict. The notion that these proxy groups are so weakened that they pose no threat is dangerously optimistic and na√Øve.

**Contention 2: Stability of the Global Oil Market**

The affirmative side argues that by targeting Iranian proxy groups, the United States can ensure stability in the global oil market, thereby safeguarding one of the world's most vital resources. They assert that the Levant region serves as a critical oil chokepoint, with 20% of the world's oil passing through there, and that by dismantling these groups, the flow of oil will be protected.

However, this argument overlooks the broader implications and unintended consequences of military intervention in the region. The use of military force to combat Iranian proxies risks disrupting not only the oil trade but also the delicate balance of power in the region. Escalating tensions through military actions can lead to retaliatory measures, including attacks on oil infrastructure, further destabilizing the global oil market.

Moreover, the assumption that the United States can unilaterally control and stabilize the oil market through military intervention is flawed. The interconnected nature of global markets means that any disruption in the Levant region will have ripple effects across the world, potentially triggering economic shocks and energy crises.

**Impact**

The negative impact of passing this bill far outweighs any perceived benefits. The risk of triggering a regional conflict, escalating tensions, and destabilizing the global oil market poses a significant threat not only to the people in the Levant but also to global security and economic stability. The potential for unintended consequences and blowback from military intervention cannot be understated.

In conclusion, the proposed bill to strengthen regional alliances to combat Iranian proxy networks in the Levant is a reckless and shortsighted approach that is likely to do more harm than good. Rather than promoting peace and stability, it risks fueling conflict and instability. I urge you to consider the long-term consequences and implications of this bill and stand in firm opposition to its passage. Thank you.
