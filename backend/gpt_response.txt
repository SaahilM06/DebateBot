Honorable Judges, Representatives, and fellow debaters,

I stand in strong opposition to the affirmative side's support for the bill aiming to strengthen regional alliances to combat Iranian proxy networks in the Levant. While the affirmative side argues that the legislation will bring peace and stability to the region, I am here to shed light on the detrimental consequences and false assumptions that underlie their arguments.

Firstly, the affirmative side asserts that the Iranian proxy networks have been significantly weakened and cannot match the military technology of the United States. However, this claim is prematurely optimistic. As explained by experts at the Institute for Policy Studies in July 2023, the Iranian proxy groups have a history of resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity. Even when weakened, these groups can reorganize, recruit new members, and continue to pose a threat to regional stability. To assume that they are incapacitated and pose no risk is dangerously naive.

Furthermore, the affirmative side argues that American presence in the region will stabilize the oil market. However, this ignores the complex dynamics at play. As highlighted by the Atlantic Council in a recent report, increased militarization and intervention in the Middle East can lead to heightened tensions, which in turn can destabilize the oil market. The use of force is not always the answer and can have unintended consequences.

Moreover, the affirmative side's reliance on the notion that America's superior technology and influence will put an end to the destruction caused by these proxy groups is problematic. History has shown us that military interventions can often exacerbate violence and lead to prolonged conflicts. As a recent study by the University of Oxford revealed, military solutions are not always effective in combating asymmetrical warfare tactics employed by proxy groups.

In conclusion, the affirmative side's arguments are based on flawed assumptions and overlook the complexities of the situation in the Levant. Military interventions and alliance-building are not always the answer and can have unintended consequences. We must approach the situation with caution and consider alternative diplomatic and humanitarian approaches to address the root causes of conflict in the region.

Thank you.
