Ethical Governance Protects Democracy
When members of Congress trade stocks, it’s not just a financial activity—it’s a conflict of
interest that undermines democracy. According to Insider on March 28, 2023, 78 members of
Congress violated the STOCK Act, which requires them to report trades to prevent insider
trading. This failure isn’t a minor bureaucratic mishap; it’s a direct threat to public trust. When
politicians profit off industries they regulate, they make decisions that benefit their bank
accounts, not their constituents.
The impact is clear: erosion of faith in democratic institutions. Gallup reports that trust in
Congress hit a historic low of 7% in 2023. Without trust, public participation plummets, voter
turnout decreases, and apathy sets in. This bill restores that trust by eliminating the temptation
for legislators to act in their financial interest, instead focusing on policies that benefit their
districts and the nation.
And let’s not pretend this is just theoretical. The New York Times on January 15, 2024, reported
cases where congressional trades preceded major policy decisions, like the banning of TikTok
or federal COVID relief. How can we trust their motives when their stock portfolios benefit?
Passing this bill ensures decisions are driven by what’s right for the public, not their
investments.
Economic Fairness for All
Rep. _____ might argue that restricting stock trading could deter talented people from serving in
Congress. But let’s face it—public service shouldn’t be a stock market side hustle. According to
The New York Times in 2024, stock market gains disproportionately benefit the wealthiest 10%
of Americans. When legislators and their families trade stocks, they’re playing in a rigged
casino, equipped with insider knowledge and connections.
Meanwhile, the average American struggles. The Economic Policy Institute reported in 2022
that wage growth for the bottom 90% has stagnated for decades. How can we expect Congress
to address issues like wealth inequality, affordable housing, or healthcare when their personal
financial gains are tied to corporate profits? The T.R.A.D.E. Act breaks this cycle by mandating
divestment and cutting the cord between personal wealth and public policy.
And Rep. _____ might suggest that blind trusts are enough, but here’s the problem: blind trusts
don’t remove ownership, only oversight. This loophole allows lawmakers to still benefit from
decisions they make, as shown by the Harvard Law Review in April 2022.
Now the negation will argue that this bill is just far too extreme. But is maintaining the status quo
worth the cost of public trust? The Harvard Law Review in April 2022 shows that comprehensive
restrictions combined with penalties, as outlined in Section 3(C) of this bill, reduce corruption in
similar systems worldwide. This isn’t an extreme measure; it’s a proven solution.





Maria fled Venezuela with her two young children, escaping economic collapse and political
turmoil that left her unable to feed her family. After a dangerous journey to the U.S., she now
faces an uncertain future, living only as a temporary resident with limited access to work,
healthcare, and security. America was built on the values of opportunity and asylum, and
passing legislation to grant permanent status to Venezuelan refugees is not just
compassionate—it is a moral and strategic necessity.
The Venezuelan refugee crisis remains one of the world’s largest yet most overlooked. As of
August 2023, CSIS reports that nearly 7.7 million have fled, many facing perilous journeys.
Even in the U.S., most remain in temporary status with limited rights. Maria’s story is not
unique—as a global humanitarian leader, the U.S. must provide a direct path to permanent
residency, ending this cycle of uncertainty. Moreover, Amnesty International emphasizes in
October of 2023 that returning Venezuelans, with temporary status,
given the risks to their lives, violates international law.
First, let’s address the humanitarian imperative. Some argue that admitting more migrants
threatens security, but this fear is unfounded. Venezuelan refugees aren’t coming to participate
in crime; rather, Harvard International Review (August 2024) highlights that poverty and lack of
education—not migration status—are the key factors pushing individuals into criminal networks.
By denying a secure path to residency, we only exacerbate these issues. This bill
prevents that by offering structured support, ensuring access to stable housing,
employment programs, and community integration. This approach mitigates risks while
reinforcing security, proving that humanitarian action and safety go hand in hand. Additionally,
Rep. K argues that most Venezuelans aren’t able to fill labor shortages because of limited work
opportunities, but guess what? That is exactly what this legislation solves.
Second, Rep. __ & Rep. __, you argue that we don’t have enough funds to host refugees, apart
from the fact that saving lives completely outweighs this, even when we take you at your highest
ground, this legislation benefits the U.S. economy. History proves that refugees revitalize
economies by filling these gaps, starting businesses, and adding cultural diversity. According to
Global Refuge, migrants have historically contributed more to the economy than they take in
public benefits. Third Way in November 2023 further confirms that Venezuelan migrants support
themselves and boost economic growth when given work authorization. This is tackled by
facilitating work visa approvals, allowing Venezuelan migrants to sustain themselves
while contributing to the economy. Meanwhile, Section 3C incentivizes higher education
and workforce development, ensuring a qualified labor force that strengthens the U.S.
industries rather than burdening them.
In conclusion, this legislation upholds our values, strengthens our economy, and provides
millions like Maria a pathway to stability and success. It ensures security while reinforcing the
U.S. as a leader in humanitarian efforts. It’s time to act—affirm today’s resolution.





America has always prided itself on being a melting pot, but when it comes to actually stirring
the pot, we tend to leave the spoon in the drawer. Our immigration policies destroy the dreams
of thousands every year. Pass today to change that.
Principally, pass because immigrants are vital to the economy.
First, let’s address the point Rep. ___ brings up about Venezuelans being a “drain” on American
resources. It’s simply false. According to a 2022 study by the Migration Policy Institute, refugee
populations often surpass native-born citizens in employment rates after five years, especially
since proper integration policies like the ESL programs outlined in this bill. When we are facing
a huge labor shortage affecting the everyday life of our constituents, especially in the crucial
sectors of agriculture and medicine. Not only passing the right thing to do, it is absolutely
crucial.
Additionally, the $100 million allocation under Section 3 is a smart investment. The American
Immigration Council explains that every dollar spent on refugee integration yields $2 in
economic output within ten years. That means more jobs, more tax revenue, and less strain on
public assistance programs. Rep. ____, you claim this bill is costly, but ignoring this opportunity
costs us more.
But second, pass for regional security in Latin America.
Rep. ___ might claim that this bill only benefits Venezuelan migrants, but that’s not it. This bill
doesn’t just address a humanitarian crisis; it provides a pathway to stabilize the entire Western
Hemisphere. Consider this: The Council on Foreign Relations reported in August 2023 that
Venezuela’s collapsing economy and oppressive regime have already driven over 7 million
migrants to flee to neighboring countries like Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. These nations are
bearing the brunt of a crisis that could spill over into political instability and regional conflict.
By granting refugee status to Venezuelans, the United States alleviates pressure on these
overburdened nations, ensuring they have the resources to maintain their own stability. This is
critical because instability in Latin America often creates a domino effect that directly impacts
the U.S. Through increased trade disruptions, weakened alliances, and surges in irregular
migration at our southern border, the consequences of inaction are far-reaching.
In fact, Brookings tells us in 2022 that regional instability is one of the leading drivers of
transnational crime, including drug trafficking and human smuggling. By absorbing a portion of
Venezuela’s migrant population, we reduce the strain on our neighbors and curtail the growth of
organized crime networks that exploit migrants and destabilize borders. This is an investment in
our own security.
Today, I just have one final question to this Congress. How many more will we stop? How many
more will we shatter? Pass.





Rep ____, I must admit, I never thought missiles would make me feel safe. But here I am,
hoping that their precision brings peace instead of pandemonium. This legislation isn't about
escalation; it's about insulation—protecting stability in a volatile region. Pass today for the safety
of the millions of innocent civilians in the Levant.
Principally, You affirm today to harbor peace for decades. AP News reported on December 8
that Iran's "Axis of Resistance" is diminishing as several groups around the region begin falling
apart. The Israel Times furthers on this just two weeks ago by reporting that the Iranian proxy
groups like Hezbollah are being knocked down. The situation for Iran is not looking up right now,
meaning that it is the perfect time for America to step in and put an end to the destruction
caused by these proxy groups. America's superior technology and influence finally puts an end
to the destruction caused by these terrorists. The main advocacy that the negation brings to the
table is that this bill creates a regional arms race. But here's the issue: when the proxy groups
are already significantly weakened, they cannot afford to spend resources to match the military
technology of America. Rep ___, this means that conflict doesn't get exacerbated, it gets lulled.
We can’t afford to waste even a second, when each day we hesitate to make a move, a
thousand people perish on the battlefields. their families Only have 3 letters to blame: U.S.A.
But lives are not the only thing at stake today.
Second, you affirm to protect and stabilize the global oil market. Reuters reports in April of 2024
that Iran is the third largest exporter of oil globally. Reuters reports in another article on
December 18, 2024 that Iranian proxy groups have increasingly gotten a hold on oil. It furthers
that the proxy groups evade the sanctions with government loopholes. When Iranian proxy
groups are taken down, the impact goes beyond reducing global terrorism or decreasing
violence in the Levant region: it also makes sure that one of the most important resources in the
world continues to be traded peacefully. But why exactly does American presence in the region
stabilize the oil market? The US Energy Information Administration explains to us that the
Levant region is one of the most vital oil chokepoints in the world, with 20% of the world's oil
passing through there. Today’s legislation uniquely protects this oil, because it’s the first time
that the US actually targets the proxy groups that are destabilizing the oil market in the first
place.
Today, the sound of the gavel for the affirmation cancels out the sound of bombs bursting, guns
firing, and civilians screaming. Millions count on your ballot today for their life. Don't let them
down. Pass.





Framework in case late round:
Only thing that matters in this round is whether or not human lives are saved from the grasp of
iranian proxy groups. Ultimately the affirmation takes the win:
- At the very least by passing we bring about defense systems; systems that STOP the
terror inflicted by iranian proxy group.
- In the negation we have no defense systems
- The only threat the negation gives you is ‘escalation’
- But they act like US has never thwarted Iran, we have before; and in the past
nothing super bad has happened.





When this bill was proposed to congress, my district was quick to ask me if I endorsed
accountability. My response to them was “ absolutely should I be at that same standard as you
all, but never will that come at the cost of my rights. “ It is for that reason that I negate.
Professor Schroeder who practiced in corporate finance for 12 years explains that the 2012
Stock Act cleared up the legal framework as to what constitutes insider trading, and additionally
it provided a recurring disclosure of congressional leaders stock trading activity every 45 days.
The mistake was tasking the Department of justice to enforce this accountability. Because this
non-partisan agency, who has pledged a stance of neutrality, if funded by congress, kept alive
by congress, and ultimately becomes the political weapon of congress. That's not accountability,
that's control. But then a BloomBerg law analysis tells us that from 2020 to 2021, over 200
lawmakers and senior staff members have allegedly violated the reporting requirements of the
STOCK Act without any indication of enforcement actions. Even if you change the enforcer from
the DOJ to the FTC, as section 3 does, the FTC still relies heavily on funding from congress.
That's the problem. Our people are constantly at the mercy of agencies that serve as the
confessional puppets, and we effectively eliminate any one who challenges the system.
But next there's a third party that we're not taking into consideration, section 1, the immediate
families. But their families aren't doing anything, making this an unwarranted punishment
against an innocent actor. Sure you can make the argument that the families of these leaders
are just as capable of insider trading, but there is insufficient evidence to justify that. Ultimately
it’s inconsistent, we provide a blanket ban without even taking into consideration the relationship
of the family to the representatives, and we overlook that the friend of a senator is just as
capable of being an insider as anyone else. You effectively target my children, their
grandparents, and their parents too from trying to sustain themselves in this unforgiving
economy. I won’t let my attempt to serve this nation be their cause to their demise. This isn't a
metric of accountability, it makes them a target. Jim Harper, director of information policy
studies of the Cato Institute explains that prohibiting congressional leaders from trading could
lead to a continuous stream of investigations targeting our representatives and their staff, many
of which could be politically motivated. Exacerbating the already ongoing problem of polarization
that plagues our congress. When I took office, I did so to protect the rights of my constituents.
Never did I imagine I would put my own rights in jeopardy by doing so. .





P1: Iranian retaliation
By passing, we implement a patriot system in countries fighting against Iranian backed proxy
groups. How powerful are patriot systems? Patriot systems serve as one of the few
interactions to Iran’s weapons. The only current one in place right now is the Iron dome*which
is only in israel. → Iranian backed proxy groups have for the most part backed away from
Israel, not just because they are clearly outmatched in personnel and funding, but specifically
because they have the iron dome(France 24 in 2024) In the past few months the groups have
been more active in places like Lebanon with Hezbollah where defense systems were nowhere
near as advanced, allowing easy pickings for the proxy groups. The issue is in the past when
Israel displayed its Iron dome, Iran HAD an alternative to focus on(Lebanon, etc.) so it wasn’t a
huge loss. Now the issue is that now the US essentially strands Iran without any more options
surrounding them. Up till now, the affirmation probably agrees with me, but here's where they
go wrong. Rather than giving up on the conflict all together, they call upon their own foreign
allies in a time of need. Iran and China have developed a growing economic and military
relationship, but unlike other allies, China only cares about two things: profits, and power. As far
as profits go, China makes money by selling arms to other countries. In the past [cia] China has
signed agreements to sell $6.3 billion of weapons, 95 percent of them to Iraq, Egypt, Iran,
Pakistan, and Libya in the past four years. If China was willing to sell to Iran in the past, there is
absolutely nothing hindering them from selling arms now. Moreover, China is Iran’s last option,
with its neighbors like Syria having just as much military tech as Iran, looking to international
superpowers like China is the only option. China not only gains money, it gains access to
Iranian markets and energy supplies. Iran and China seem to have a perfect win-win deal when
we pass.
But what does that mean for the United States and Iran?
First for Iran:
Iran finds an escape; not just now, but forever. When China and Iran become partners, they
become inseparable. But Iran quickly sees its own death.
“Since Sri Lanka defaulted on a Chinese loan a year ago, a half-million industrial jobs have
vanished, inflation has pierced 50% and more than half the population in many parts of the
country has fallen into poverty. In Pakistan the government can’t keep the electricity on. In
Zambia, the government was forced to cut spending on healthcare, social services and
subsidies to farmers for seed and fertilizer.”

Second for the United States:
The United States has a permanent counterbalance in the region, whereas now the US is one of
the only countries that's ever involved its military in Middle Eastern affairs. That permanently
disables the US to stop conflict, and ultimately handicaps any problem solving and life saving
ability we have in the region.





When former felonist Tyrone muhammad was released from state prison he went on to start a
violence prevention program to protect the African-American community in chicago. But that
dream was cut short. Tyrone returned to a flood of Venezuelan criminal gang activity, much of
which targeted his own community. Tyrone's final straw was watching this government coddle
these criminals. That's my final straw as well, fail this legislation.
Principally, fail to prioritize our constituents first.
To enhance their country's safety, Venezuela is releasing prisoners and sending them to the
United States, where they will be provided with shelter. Dana Kennedy at the New York post
tells us that Tyrone described the situation as blacks vs migrants. Chicago spent almost half a
billion dollars over the last two years on more than 42,000 migrants who’ve arrived since 2022.
Pushing out local african americans, so they can get more government money for housing
migrants. There are entire areas controlled by these gangs, 720 police incident reports against
them, yet these gang members are being released by courts. A black teen told the post that
they don't get arrested like we do, they receive help to get cars, apartments, EBT cards, and
thousands of dollars whilst not even having a social security number. These are bad people.
Affirming today means we prioritize migrants over people we were elected to serve, our own
constituents.
Second, negate because of an excessive backlog.
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse
At the end of November 2024, out of the total backlog of 3,738,341 cases, 1,740,424 immigrants
have already filed formal asylum applications and are now waiting for asylum. Asylum seekers
go into detention centers, or into areas that accept them and have support networks. Then the
National immigration forum states that the Biden administration hit 4% of their resettlement
goal for immigrants in 2021, part of which is because we shifted our focus to Afghan evacuees,
with the underlying problem being that they were stretched too thin. USRAP is who governs the
procedure by which refugees around the world are screened and selected, yet their not even
mentioned in the bill, it’s a multifaceted process, and multiple institutions are tasked to oversee
After referral, refugees undergo pre-screening at Resettlement Support Centers, followed by
detailed USCIS interviews. They then face extensive security and health checks. Once cleared,
they are matched with U.S. resettlement agencies, receive cultural orientation, and initial
support for three months. Processing times have increased from 18-24 months to up to 10 years
due to additional vetting and other challenges. When the process takes so long, we don't see
any of the impacts that the affirmation brings up.
Tyrone left a community that was impoverished and fragmented, we had 20 years to change
that, yet he still returned to the exact same thing. Fail this legislation, and protect the people that
you were elected to serve.
